# Job Searching Optimizer
As a new grad, I found some company when they post a job online, thy would put the job under entry lvl and associate lvl and ask for 5 - 10 years of experience. And some job that is recommend to me doesn't really fit my skill set. So I decided to make my own job searching database and use NLP and AI to optimize my job searching experience.
